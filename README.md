# Introduction

This is a dotnet port of [smole-ai/developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer), mostly created by asking chatGpt to translate the python script to dotnet and a few manual tweaks. 

I've added some really basic ChatGPT classes, so it doesn't depend on any 3rd party nuget packages. 

Just add your API_KEY to the first line, and run.

The default prompt from smole-ai/developer demo is set in the Properties folder in launchSettings.json

not to be taken seriously, it's just for fun.

Micheal.
